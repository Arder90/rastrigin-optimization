Rastrigin Optimization using GA, DE, and PSO
This project implements three population-based metaheuristic algorithms to minimize the 2D Rastrigin function:
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Differential Evolution (DE)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

The function optimized is:
\[
f(x, y) = 20 + x^2 + y^2 - 10[\cos(2\pi x) + \cos(2\pi y)]
\]
with a search domain: **-5.12 ≤ x, y ≤ 5.12** and a global minimum at (0,0).
